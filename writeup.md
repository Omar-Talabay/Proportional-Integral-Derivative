Answer the following questions:
- Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)
- What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?
- How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters?
- PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller?
- (Optional) What would you do to improve the PID controller?


### Tips:

- When you wil be testing your c++ code, restart the Carla simulator to remove the former car from the simulation.
- If the simulation freezes on the desktop mode but is still running on the terminal, close the desktop and restart it.
- When you will be tuning the PID parameters, try between those values:
